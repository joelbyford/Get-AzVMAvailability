## Future Enhancements (Backlog)

### Capacity Recommender Enhancements

- [ ] **Workload Profiles** - Pre-tuned scoring weights for MemoryOptimized, ComputeOptimized, GPU
- [ ] **`-AnyRegion`** - Scan all public regions automatically
- [ ] **`-RegionGeo`** - Filter by geography (US, Europe, AsiaPacific)

### PowerShell Module Refactoring
- [ ] **Module Structure** - Refactor into `AzVMAvailability` module with Public/Private functions
- [ ] **Backward-Compatible Wrapper** - Keep `Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1` as entry point
- [ ] **Shared Helpers** - Enable reuse across scanner, recommender, and Agent

### Azure Resource Graph Integration

- [ ] **Cross-Subscription Discovery** - Use ARG to discover all accessible subscriptions faster
- [ ] **Deployment Density** - Visualize how many VMs are already in each region

- [ ] **Capacity Alerts** - Notify when capacity status changes
- [ ] **Azure Monitor Integration** - Log results to Log Analytics
- [ ] **Azure Function Deployment** - Run as scheduled serverless function
- [ ] **REST API Wrapper** - Expose as lightweight API

---

## Future: AVD Capacity Planning Mode
**Theme: Azure Virtual Desktop Host Pool Sizing**

AVD deployments depend on VM SKU availability and quota (already covered), but a dedicated AVD mode would close the remaining gap between raw capacity data and host pool readiness.

### Proposed Features
- [ ] **`-AvdMode` Parameter** - Switch to AVD-focused output with host pool context
- [ ] **Session Model Input** - Accept user count + session type (Personal vs Pooled) to compute required VM count
- [ ] **VM Count Calculator** - Derive required VMs from concurrent user target and users-per-VM ratio
- [ ] **Host Pool Quota Check** - Validate that subscription quota covers the full host pool VM count
- [ ] **SKU Guidance** - Flag AVD-recommended families (DSv5, Dasv5, NVv4 for GPU) and warn on unsupported SKUs
- [ ] **Spot Integration** - Flag pooled hosts as Spot-eligible when eviction tolerance is low (links to placement score feature)
- [ ] **Capacity + Quota Pass/Fail Summary** - Single green/red readiness signal per region

### Notes
- Builds on existing SKU availability + quota scan — no new Azure API dependency
- Pooled host sizing math: `ceil(ConcurrentUsers / UsersPerVM)` with optional buffer percentage
- Personal host sizing math: `1 VM per assigned user`
- Spot placement scores (feature/placement-score-phase1) are directly relevant for cost-optimized pooled AVD
- AVD session planning decisions needed before implementation
